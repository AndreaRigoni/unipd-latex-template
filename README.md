This is a fork of Dissertate, a modern LaTeX template for a thesis or disseration, adapted to the UNIPD style. This is not an official template, check if your Department has specific requirements for the Thesis template. [Here's a sample](http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/52719/1/tesi_michele_polese.pdf).

**Note**: if you are just here for the template, download it here (also with instructions on how to use it):
